\subsection{The Entanglement Cost of One-Shot Compression}
In a similar vein, one can also ask about how much entanglement is necessary for compression.
A separate paper by Hadiashar and Nayak~\cite{BabHadiashar2020entanglementcostof}
it is shown that there exist ensembles which are incompressible without entanglement
but requires only O\((\log\log\frac{1}{\eps})\) overhead above the Holevo information when allowed entanglement in the one-shot scenario.
\begin{theorem}
    There exist universal constants \(c_1, c_2 > 0\) such that for any \(\eps \in (0,1)\),
    any \(k, m \in \En\) satisfying \(k \ge 6/(1-\eps)\) and \(m \ge c_1(\ln k)/(1-\eps)^2\),
    there exists an ensemble
    \[\left(\left(\frac{1}{n},\rho_x\right) : x \in [n], \rho_x \in \Dens(\Cee^m)\right)\]
    which satisfies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(I(X:C)_\tau = I_{\max}(X:C)_\tau = \log_2 k\),
        where \(\tau \coloneq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{x \in [n]}\opproj{x}^\tsf{A}\ot \rho_x^\tsf{B}\)
        \item there exists a one-way protocol with shared entanglement for visible compression of the ensemble with global error at most \(\eps/2\) and communication cost
        \(\frac{1}{2} \log k + O(\log \log \frac{1}{\eps})\)
        \item the sum of communication and entanglement cost of \emph{any} one-way protocol with global error at most \(\eps/2\) is at least
        \[\log m - 3\log\frac{1}{1-\eps}-c_2\]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Operationally the first two conditions simply ask that the Holevo information of the ensemble can be arbitrarily small relative to the dimension of the ambient space,
and characterizes the optimal visible compression rate with one-shot overhead.
The meat is in the third condition, which says that void of entanglement
the ensemble is incompressible again near-maximally with leading term saturating the dimension bound.
