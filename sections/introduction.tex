\subsection{Introduction}
Shannon's entropy~\cite{shannon} has found widespread success in classical information theory.
Its generalization to quantum ensembles in the form of von Neumann entropy has found similar success in non-commutative settings~\cite{schumacher}.
One specific area of focus is on quantum compression, which aims to send randomly sampled states from a pre-agreed upon distribution using as few qubits as possible.
While a lot of results are known in the zero-error regime (as we have seen in lectures),
much less is known when some error is allowed.
This project seeks to examine two cases of incompressibility:
one as a general incompressibility result,
and the other relative to the cost of entanglement,

% One distinction between quantum and classical compression is the notion of blind versus visible compression~\cite{winter2002compression}.
% Classically, one is always able to perfectly distinguish the symbols emitted from the source without disturbing them.
% This is almost never true for quantum states, however.



% It is well known that the optimal compression ratio in the visible case is the Holevo information of the ensemble~\cite{horodecki_mixed, bcfjs2001}.
% In the blind case,
